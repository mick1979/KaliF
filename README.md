# KaliF

This is a group of scripts I wrote in python to help install some of the best tools I liked in the past year. These have helped me achieve things. It is my first program, but I don't mind about anything else. 

It's good for me because I can install what I need when I need it. And as I have learned over the last year how to rebuild broken packages and distributions, these tools helped to learn how to apply my basic set of python3 skills into a usable format. 

The magnet for the torrent is here:

Some of the scripts KaliF install's, most if not all of the repositories mentioned are here in my channel. 

Thanks.
